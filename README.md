# Datathon 2023 
Host: KU Leuven

This project attempts to find possible factors that could help existing GAN models discern between real and AI images. 

## Data information: 
The datasets, provided by KU Leuven, could be found in the FilesCSVFormat folder and include:
  - Scraped data from Wikipedia and meta-data of artists and artworks. 
  - Frame of AI generated images using a text-to-image model
  - Information and Entity-Relation diagram on the datasets provided

## Documentation
  - Data Processing: tabular processing and image preprocessing of scripts and dataframes 
  - GAN Detection: outputs using an existing GAN model based on resnet50
  - Image Features: outputs of feature extractions of images 
  - Community Dection: graphical exploration using Neo4j
